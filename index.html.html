	<h2>About me</h2>
	<p>Welcome to my portfolio! My name is <em>Taseen</em> and I reside in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. I'm thrilled (a little daunted) to attend Merivale Highschool as an Pre-IB student starting the school of 2023. I have a very keen interest in classical music and eagerly want to learn as many instruments, I currently play the saxophone. I have previously attended Bell High School and I'm very popular in Bell. I will miss Bell High School and my popular days. I aspire to travel the world and pursue a career in either medical or engineering field.</p>

<p> My country of origin is Bangladesh. I've spent 9 year of life there before immigrating to Canada. My extended family lives over there and I miss them dearly, specially during family reunions. If you are reading this, consider investing money on me because I need money for university. Thanks!</p>
